# Spring Boot Microservices Project
**Student:** Abdulla Abu Muamar 
**Branch:** main branch in abdullaMicroservices repo  


## What I Built  
- **Eureka Server**: Service discovery for dynamic scaling  
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to microservices  
- **Student-Service**: REST API managing students  
- **Unique Feature**: Added "favorite drink" field  

## Why These Technologies?  
- **Eureka** tracks services dynamically

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Checkout your branch  
3. Run Eureka Server  
4. Run API Gateway  
5. Run Student Service
